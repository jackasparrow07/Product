This is a Prototype (or MVP) I created for a client from Ireland based on his requirements.
Later client used this to scale up and create a more robust app for their internal company purposes.



Run the project using:
streamlit run implement.py

You require:
1. Free groq api key from their console panel website page
2. Data analysis CSV or XLSX type file with size less than 5 MB.
